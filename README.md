# Florida PyCon

We are currently in the initial stages of planning the first ever Florida PyCon!

It's still early in the planning phase, but here's what we know:

------

- Florida PyCon will be the **first Saturday in October** (2017-10-07) from **8AM to 5PM**
- The conference will be held in **Orlando, FL** at the Exchange downtown:
    Church Street Station Exchange
    101 S Garland Ave
    Orlando, FL  32801
- To provide the best experience for attendees in our first year, we will be **limiting attendance**. We're still working on the exact number
- We will be kickstarting Orlando Tech Week with the [Orlando Tech Association](http://orlandotech.org)
